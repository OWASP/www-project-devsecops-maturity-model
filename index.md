With the advent of Agile frameworks, Enterprises and SMBs are shipping software - fast! According to the [Verizon 2020 Breach Investigation Report](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf) and [anecdotal evidence](https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/) we see from the macro environment, application vulnerabilities are increasingly the most common attack vector. There are a lot of reasons why we as developer first organizations shelve security as a backlog item for some future sprint. A few reasons could be: security is hard, we have feature deadlines to meet, security is disruptive to my dev workflows. **The DevSecOps Maturity Model is an opinionated developer first framework for evaluating application security practices to ensure the applications we are shipping and their destination(s) are secure.** DSOMM seeks to embody the principles of "[DevSecOps](https://resources.github.com/whitepapers/Architects-guide-to-DevOps/)" by enabling developers and security engineers to partner in a _joint ownership model_ of the applications they are delivering.   

Attackers are intelligent and creative, equipped with new technologies and purpose. Under the guidance of the forward-looking DevSecOps Maturity Model, the right culture, people, processes and tools are in place to effectively reduce the attack surface of your applications and therefore thwarting bad actors.
